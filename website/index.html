    <p>
      Dyad is a way for your Android smartphones and tablets to
      communicate directly.  The Dyad Server assists in establishing a
      fast and secure communication channel.  The Dyad clients can
      send data over this channel without the further intervention of
      a server.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dyad Project is completely open source and app developers
      can use it freely to build apps.  Dyad powers apps that make
      phone and video calls, send text messages, move files, or
      otherwise share data peer-to-peer.
